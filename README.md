# CodeRefract
This is the Code Refractor homework assignment where we are instructed to update the code in the Develop folder.

Our job is to ensure that 
-HTML is semantically correct
-A logical flow of html elements
-All links are workng
-Title is logical
-Images have alt tags
-CSS selectors and properties are efficient

I changed the code using a methodology that does not alter the current dipslay of the website and included semantic elements to explain what is going on within the file.

I have modified some html tags, updated the corresponding CSS file, and removed excess clutter as I spotted them.

This assignment really gave me clarity to the idea of keeping code refined and polished for all who visit. It can be extremely costly and time consuming to refractor a webpage after launching so it is important to identify these elements in the beginning stages of implementation.
